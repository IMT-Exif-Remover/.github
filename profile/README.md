## üöÄ Overview

IMT Exif Remover is a simple yet powerful utility for macOS that lets you erase EXIF metadata from digital images (JPEG and HEIC input) with just a few clicks. Privacy-minded users, photographers, or anyone sharing images will appreciate being able to remove information like camera model, timestamp, GPS location, and other hidden data that travel with photos.

Instead of manually opening each photo in editors or using complex command-line tools, you just drag images into the app, hit Save, and get clean versions. Recent versions also support HEIC input and convert HEIC images to JPEG output, reducing file size while preserving the visual content.
