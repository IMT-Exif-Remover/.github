## üöÄ Overview

IMT Exif Remover is a simple yet powerful utility for macOS that lets you **erase EXIF metadata** from digital images (especially JPEG, and now HEIC input) with just a few clicks. Privacy-minded users, photographers, or anyone sharing images will appreciate being able to remove info like camera model, timestamp, GPS location, and other hidden data that can travel with a photo by accident.

Instead of manually opening each photo and stripping metadata via complex tools, you just drag images into the app, hit Save, and get clean versions. The recent versions also support HEIC input and convert HEIC images to JPEG output, reducing file size while preserving the visual content.
